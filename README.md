# FyshOS Design

This repository is home of the design documentation and assets for the FyshOS project.
As there are many smaller components that make up such a large project we use this space to coordiniate and communicate plans and ambitions.

## Target audience

FyshOS is designed to be easy to install, learn and use day-to-day.
We prepare all apps with standard configuration for the average user, with options for more "power user" options where appropriate.

## Design

In general the design aesthetic is to be in-keeping with the [Fyne toolkit](https://fyne.io) that it is built from.
At this time our base is Fyne 2.3, which draws inspiration from [Material Design](https://material.io) 2.

## Naming

We like puns and also the fish theme that brought the FyshOS name from within the Fyne project.
However we do not want to fall in to the common Linux mistake of making it hard to discover applications.
The "F" or "Fy" prefix should only be used where it makes sense like "Fyles" or "Fysh-Settings" (items that are part of the OS)
but should be discoraged where users would be searching by name or command for an application.
An app could have a unique name and a common keyword to aid discovery such as "Fybro Messenger".
